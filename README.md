# Priests and devils puzzle

#### Problem description

*   There are three priests and three devils on the right side of the river.

* They have a boat that can carry at most two people at a time.

* At no point can the devils on either side of the river outnumber the priests, or else the devils will eat the priests.

The challenge is to find a sequence of boat trips that allows all three priests and three devils to safely reach the other side of the river without breaking the rules.

## What I learned.

* To find and apply clear conditions to define neighboring nodes in a tree data structure.
* To implement Breadth First Search.
* To use a queue data structure.
